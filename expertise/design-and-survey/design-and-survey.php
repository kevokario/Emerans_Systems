                        <h2>Design &AMP; Survey</h2>
                        <p> Our systems accept excel data input i.e schemes allocated, indicating on the map that’s
                            (integrated on the system), exact location of the schemes. This helps you in planning
                            logistics of material transportation to the site, the route to use, and the type of vehicle to
                            use. You’ll be able to plan for a cluster schemes to co-ordinate their materials from one
                            central point easily.
                            From the design BOQ or pegging data the system generates all the materials required to
                            completely construct a specific scheme. In addition, it generates the labour required and a
                            budget for the scheme.
                            Once the materials are generated the Design Engineers has the privilege to approve or
                            reject the output materials before they’re exported to the construction engineer for scheme
                            allocation, requisition authorization and Gantt chart preparation.
                            This is swiftly done by sending a notification to the construction engineer for their action
                            after Design Engineer has approved a scheme.

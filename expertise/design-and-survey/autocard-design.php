                        Emeran Designers comprises of trained and certified Draftsmen, who are qualified and experienced in power line designs.
                        Data communication between the surveyors and AutoCAD designers (Back office team),
                        contributes much to the speed and quality of designs achieved.
                        weâ€™ve created and implemented efficient mediums of data transfer between the departments involved.
                        i.e between the surveyor and the back-office team.
                        Data from the field is now received in real-time by the back-office team.
                        We have also improved the interaction and communication between the surveyors and the back-office team to understand the designs much better.

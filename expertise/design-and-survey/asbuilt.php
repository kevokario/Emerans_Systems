                    <p> Asbuilt data is required to update "As constructed" data on the clients field utility database "As is" on site.
                        Material used data is also captured during asbuilt data collection.
                        Invoicing is also done from asbuilt data hence its very important to engage professionals in this area.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our field personnel have been trained and equipment provided that will help collect all major data required for As constructed schemes projects
                        From the data collected its uploaded on our management system and a list of all materials used on the project is generated.
                        This data is necessary for materials reconciliation and invoicing. The data will also be used to generate AutoCAD files for as constructed schemes and update the power utility database.

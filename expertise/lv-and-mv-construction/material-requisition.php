                    Determining the materials required to construct a scheme/project completely can be tedious and erroneous, the system comes in hand by using the data pegged for final construction design, to generate materials required to fully construct the scheme to standard.
                    The generated list once approved by construction engineer/manager is exported as is to store for material issuing, this makes material issuing process easy, fast and accurate.
                    The construction team is only required to generate the pegging data and the individual material generation is worked out by our ERP system accurately.

                    The electrification ERP system comprises of several modules that helps run electrification 
                    project from design, store, construction reporting to As-built, material reconciliation.
                    On the design the system generates the total materials required to completely construct a scheme.
                    On the store module the system is able to detect the materials already in store 
                    and flag if materials are running low. it issues materials and generates a delivery note 
                    as per the exported materials as designed/pegged.
                    On Construction it indicates the construction progress of every scheme as allocated to 
                    different construction teams or subcontractors generating a Gantt chart. On Reports, 
                    the system generates reports as per scheme and also the overall progress of the project. 
                    On material reconciliation the system captures all materials used in site, 
                    and does a comparison with the materials issued for
                    that specific site. and gives the difference. among many other functions in the system

                    In our brain storming sessions, we’ve been able to get ideas and
                    views on how best we can improve our customized ERP, for effective project implementation.
                    We train our ERP operators, who are well conversant with the overall project. 
                    They’re able to advice and
                    signal when one area in the overall project delays or is overlooked. Hence,
                    we’re able to handle risks before they affect the project and plan according.
